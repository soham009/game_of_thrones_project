# Game of Thrones 

Game of Thrones is a hit fantasy tv show based on the equally famous book series "A Song of Fire and Ice" by George RR Martin. The show is well known for its vastly complicated political landscape, large number of characters, and its frequent character deaths.


## Content
Of course, it goes without saying that this dataset contains spoilers ;)

This dataset combines three sources of data, all of which are based on information from the book series.

Firstly, there is battles.csv which contains Chris Albon's "The War of the Five Kings" Dataset. Its a great collection of all of the battles in the series.

Secondly we have character-deaths.csv from Erin Pierce and Ben Kahle. This dataset was created as a part of their Bayesian Survival Analysis.

Finally we have a more comprehensive character dataset with character-predictions.csv. It includes their predictions on which character will die.

Finally we have a more comprehensive character dataset with character-predictions.csv. This comes from the team at A Song of Ice and Data who scraped it from http://awoiaf.westeros.org/ . It also includes their predictions on which character will die, the methodology of which can be found here: (machine-learning-algorithm)[https://got.show/machine-learning-algorithm-predicts-death-game-of-thrones]
